# MotifSearch

I created this project to aid with a dermatology research lab on the CU Anschutz campus. They reached out to me because they were working on a project that required finding patterns ('Motifs') in tankyrase binding proteins. I consulted with them a few times to understand what they needed the program to do and was able to create a working Jupyter notebook where they can input fasta.txt files and receive detailed output about each of the motifs and their 'strengths'.
